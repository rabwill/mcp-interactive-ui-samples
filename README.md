# MCP based interactive UI samples for Microsoft 365 Copilot

This repository contains sample MCP servers with rich interactive UI widgets that render inside Microsoft 365 Copilot. Use these samples to learn how to build declarative agents with visually rich tool responses.

## Interactive UI in Copilot

You can add interactive UI widgets to your declarative agents by adding a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server-based action to your agent and extending the MCP tools used by the agent to include UI. Microsoft 365 Copilot supports UI widgets created using the following methods:

- **[MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.github.io/ext-apps/api/documents/Overview.html)** — An extension to MCP that enables MCP servers to deliver interactive user interfaces to hosts.
- **[OpenAI Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk)** — Tools to build ChatGPT apps based on the MCP Apps standard with extra ChatGPT functionality.


## Samples

### Field Service Dispatch

| Create a high-priority initial inspection for claim CN202504990 scheduled for next Monday, and assign it to an inspector who specializes in fire damage. | Lists inspectors, picks one with fire damage specialization, and creates the inspection — chains three tools automatically. |
| Which claims have the highest estimated losses? Show me the top ones and compare their damage types. | Opens the dashboard sorted by estimated loss descending, then the AI analyzes damage types across high-value claims to surface patterns. |
| Show the claim detail for claim 1.
