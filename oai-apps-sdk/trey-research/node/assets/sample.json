    "shortDescription": "A Declarative Agent that wraps a Trey Research MCP Server into a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent using the Agents Toolkit (ATK) in VS Code. Instead of hand-authoring an OpenAPI spec, ATK points at the MCP discovery URL and uses the OpenAI SDK to generate all manifests, wiring in authentication and function definitions automatically. The agent enables consultant management including searching consultants, viewing profiles, assigning consultants to projects, and displaying HR dashboards.",

    "longDescription": [
      "This sample demonstrates how to wrap an existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server into a Microsoft 365 Copilot Declarative Agent using the Agents Toolkit (ATK) in VS Code. The Trey Research MCP agent provides consultant management capabilities including searching consultants by skill or name, viewing detailed consultant profiles, assigning consultants to projects, bulk editing consultant records, and displaying HR dashboards with KPIs. Instead of hand-authoring an OpenAPI spec, you point ATK at your MCP discovery URL and use the OpenAI SDK to generate all manifests, wiring in authentication and function definitions automatically."
