    "shortDescription": "A Declarative Agent that wraps a Zava Insurance MCP Server with rich UI into a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent using the Agents Toolkit (ATK) in VS Code. The MCP server uses the OpenAI App SDK to render rich adaptive cards and interactive widgets. Instead of hand-authoring an OpenAPI spec, ATK points at the MCP discovery URL and generates all manifests, wiring in tools, function definitions automatically. The agent enables insurance claims management including viewing claims dashboards, claim details, managing inspections, contractors, and purchase orders.",

    "longDescription": [
      "This sample demonstrates how to wrap an existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server with rich UI into a Microsoft 365 Copilot Declarative Agent using the Agents Toolkit (ATK) in VS Code. The MCP server leverages the OpenAI App SDK to render rich adaptive cards and interactive widgets, providing a visually engaging experience directly within Copilot. The Zava Insurance MCP agent provides insurance claims management capabilities including displaying claims dashboards with status overview and filters, viewing detailed claim information, creating and updating inspections, managing contractors, and handling purchase orders. Instead of hand-authoring an OpenAPI spec, you point ATK at your MCP discovery URL and let the toolkit generate all manifests, wiring in tools and function definitions automatically."
